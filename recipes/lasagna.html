        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, <br>
        made in very wide, flat sheets.</p>
        <p>This Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating <br>
        with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel <br>
        sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, <br>
        and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with <br>
        grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked <br>
        pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. <br>
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or <br>
        rectangular portions.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Meat:</b> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><b>Onion and garlic:</b> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Tomato products:</b> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Lasagna noodles:</b> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><B>Cheeses:</B> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><b>Egg:</b> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
