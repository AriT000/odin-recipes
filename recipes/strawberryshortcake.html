        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Strawberry shortcake is a classic summertime treat.</p>
        <p>Shortcake generally  refers to a dessert with a crumbly scone-like texture. <br>
        There are multiple variations of shortcake, most of which are served with fruit <br>
        and cream. One of the most popular is strawberry shortcake, which is typically <br>
        served with whipped cream.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strawberries:</b> Of course, a strawberry shortcake needs strawberries. This recipe calls for six cups of fresh strawberries.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> You'll use white sugar for both the strawberries and the shortcake.</li>
            <li><b>Flour:</b> This strawberry shortcake is made almost like biscuits, so you'll need 2 Â¼ cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><b>Baking Powder:</b> Baking powder helps the shortcake rise.</li>
            <li><b>Salt:</b> Just a hint of salt adds a depth of flavor to the shortcake.</li>
            <li><b>Butter:</b> Butter is a classic shortcake ingredient.</li>
            <li><b>Egg:</b> One egg binds the dough together.</li>
            <li><b>Half-and-half:</b> This will make the dough rich and moist, but reviewers say they've also had success using milk instead.</li>
            <li><b>Whipped Heavy Cream:</b> Sweetened vanilla whipped cream tops this cake.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
